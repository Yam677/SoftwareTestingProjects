## 📝 Test Cases

Test cases are detailed step-by-step scenarios used to validate the software functionality against the requirements.

### Test Case Categories:
1. **Functional Test Cases**  
   - Validating core business logic
   - Ensuring correct output based on input combinations
2. **UI Test Cases**  
   - Layout verification, alignment, colors, responsiveness
3. **Regression Test Cases**  
   - Re-validating old features after code changes

### Test Case Format:
- **Test ID**
- **Test Scenario**
- **Preconditions**
- **Test Steps**
- **Expected Result**
- **Actual Result**
- **Status (Pass/Fail)**
- **Comments**

Test cases are available in `.xlsx` format for clarity and easy use during manual execution.
